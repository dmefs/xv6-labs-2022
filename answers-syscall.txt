Q1:Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A1:usertrap

Q2:What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? 
(Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A2:
value = 7.
It's index of sys_exec in syscalls array.

Q3:What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A3:User mode

Q4:Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. 
Which register corresponds to the varialable num?
A4: lw	a3,0(zero)
register a3

Q5:Why does the kernel crash? 
Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? 
Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? 
(See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A5:
scause 0x000000000000000d
Load Page Fault

Q6:What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? 
What is its process id (pid)?
A6: initcode
pid = 1
